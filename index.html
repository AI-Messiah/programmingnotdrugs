        <p class="content-text">People would say that I should get a job and it doesn't seem like I have been up-to much. Actually I have been coding a-lot of this time. I have been coding when I have had access to a computer and had the time to do it.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="content-text">I would really like to make a living writing code which would mostly be games.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="content-text">I have a lifetimes experience in programming. I have done it since people used 8-bit computers. In fact I have understood parts of it from grade 3. from grade 5 I started using trigonometric functions although I remember them in grade 3.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="content-text">When I was 19 I started writing code in visual basic and at the time it seemed like the only other way to program for Windows was with C++ or visual C++ which I could not afford. That stunted my coding ability for a while until one day I discovered Processing 3 and from there I tried to add features that meant I had to learn other things and that made me aware of the wide range of programming languages that existed as open sourced languages.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="content-text">I eventually found OpenGL and learned enough to make games and I have studied Vulkan and DirectX.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="content-text">I find that game engines are quite useless. I like to do things as hard coded even though I do use object oriented coding.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="content-text">I am what you would call 'A lazy coder' this does not mean I do not finish the job. It is that I try to find the easiest way to do things instead of going through the frustration of doing things head on.</p>
